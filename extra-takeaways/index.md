# Takeaways

Five things I learned this semester:

1. Coding on GitHub with simple syntax and creating GitHub Pages repository websites.
2. Being inclusive is important, and we should try to do the minimum by improving accessibility for visitors who do not have the ability to see/hear our content.
3. Telling our story helps getting others more invested in us as creators and supporting us.
4. What makes people more interested in what we have to offer is sharing our knowledge and experience.
5. The way we speak to our audience is as important as the content we put out.
