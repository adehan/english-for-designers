# Storytelling
* "Stories are key to helping people decide if they want to work with you, invest in your project, or refer you to someone else."

#### Brainstorming
Mention only moments throughout my life that are relevant to my artistic journey
1. Growing up in a village -> spending time in nature helped my creative thinking, inspired me to draw, and I developed a great fondness for nature and fantasy elements
2. School experience -> hated it, spent time doodling in class and writing stories because I was bored
3. Struggles with art block -> Teachers and people around me were discouraging me from pursuing art as a career, which lead to a long art block
4. Decided to be stubborn and pursue it anyway
5. Started studying illustration and character design on my own
6. Got my first freelance work, started building my eshop
