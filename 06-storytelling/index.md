# Storytelling

#### My journey
Mention only moments throughout out my life that are relevant to my artistic journey
1. Growing up in a village -> spending time in nature helped my creative thinking and inspired me to draw, developed a great fondness for nature and fantasy elements
2. School experience -> hated it, spent time doodling in class and writing stories because I was bored
3. Teachers and people around me were discouraging me from pursuing art as a career, which...
4. Lead to an art block
5. Decided to be stubborn and pursue it anyway
6. Started studying illustration and character design on my own
7. Got my first freelance work, started building my eshop
8. ...
9. That was only the beginning. There's so much to be done!
