# Review

**1. What did you like most about this subject?**
- The friendly and progressive environment was a breath of fresh air, and it's much appreciated.
- That the topics and learning were useful, practical and relevant to what we do. No unnecessary theory or tests.
- Using Slack for communication, assignments and sharing interesting links. It made things a lot easier/less time-consuming.

**2. What did you like least about this subject?**
- Working with Github â€“ Because I'm not familiar with coding, it was a struggle to learn how to use it, and I feel like I spent a lot of unnecessary time trying to figure it out. The beginning was a bit frustrating. Even now, I still don't feel comfortable using it. I'd prefer if there was an alternative for people who don't want to use Github next time. Then I would be much more excited about working on assignments :D

**3. What were the top 3 things you learned this year?**
- How to write/design a CV, create case studies (SO helpful).
- The importance of storytelling, voice and tone. This is something that I think we haven't talked about much in other classes.

**4. What was the most memorable activity/assignment from this year?**
  My favourite assignment was probably the first one when we were making the letter because it was the most creative.

**5. What is something you accomplished this year that you are proud of?**
- Finishing the thesis is a big one. It's FAR from perfect, but I'm still proud of it. I haven't really written longer texts in Czech since finishing middle school, so it was very difficult for me.

**6. What is one thing you learned about yourself this year?**
- That I'm worse at procrastinating than I thought.

**7. What is one thing you would add or change about this class?**
- The Github thing.
- Add more creative assignments (like the first one).
- Add more activities/topics that would spark discussion in the classroom.

**8. What is one thing you could have done better this year?**
- Keeping an eye on the deadlines.

**9. What is one thing I could have done better as a teacher this year?**
- Encourage more discussions in the classroom.

**10. What advice would you give to students going into this subject next year?**
- To not miss the classes because they're very helpful.
