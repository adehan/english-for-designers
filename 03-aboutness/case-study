# Posterheroes 2020
“Humans at Work” was the title of the 2020 Posterheroes competition, which asked the international creative community to express their vision on the theme of work and workers by creating a 70×100 cm poster.
In the end, the international jury, made up of graphics, art and communication experts chose 40 winners out of over 3500 entries from over 117 countries. I was one of the lucky winners of this competition.

What I chose to portray was labour explotation, which is a global issue that affect tens of millions of people all over the world today, yet is not being talked about enough. 
My goal was to design a poster that would crearly depicts the explotation of poor immigrant workers by their employer.





The final poster was displayed at Náplavka in Prague and Toolbox Coworking in Turin, Italy, during the international festival Graphic Days.
