# Voice & Tone  

## Voice  

* Voice is a part of my brand and should reflect what I want to achieve with my work. My art should focus mainly on nature, fantasy themes, characters and invoke the feeling of adventure but also warm coziness. Since I'm not presenting my work only on social media, but also myself as an artist, I want to share personal stories, interesting insight or introspections people might relate to, while also having fun with it and not taking myself too seriously.  

#### Voice characteristics  
* Friendly, personal and genuine  
* Calm playfullness  

## Tone  
* Slighly changes accordingly to situation but always stays informal and calm/positive  

## Style  

#### Dos:  
* Correct grammar, use British English   
* Informal voice  
* Simple words and phrases  
* Use emojis and symbols  

#### Don'ts:  
* Overly serious tone  
* Hard to read, long sentences  
* Unusual, complex words  

Examples of where I used voice correctly – aboutness:  

I’m a Czech artist that grew up in a tiny village in Moravia, surrounded by beautiful groves and apple orchards. From an early age, I showed a particular interest in drawing. It all started with me creating all kinds of critters that I liked to imagine live in the woods near my family house, where you could often find me sketching and reading books. I developed a great fondness for nature and fantasy elements, which is reflected in my work. It revolves mostly around colourful characters, creatures and environments.
When I’m not drawing, I like to indulge in my other passions that include a love for storytelling, playing games, wandering the woodlands, petting dogs and napping under trees.
I am always looking for new projects and creative opportunities, so feel free to contact me!
