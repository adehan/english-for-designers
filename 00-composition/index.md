Instructions:

Step 1: Draw a small circle. This is going to be the centre of the object. No lines ever go through it - the inside of the circle is always empty. 
Step 2: There are several lines coming from the edge of the circle. All of them are the same length. Draw the first line that is pointing to the North and has a black triangle at the end (it looks like an arrow).
Step 3: Draw the second line that is pointing to the East and has a black triangle at the end.
Step 4: Draw the third line that is pointing to the South-East and has a black triangle at the end.
Step 5: Draw the fourth line that is pointing to the South. This one has no triangle at the end.
Step 6: Draw the fifth line that is pointing to the West. This one has no triangle at the end.
Step 7: Draw a sixth line that is pointing to the North-West. This one has no triangle at the end.
