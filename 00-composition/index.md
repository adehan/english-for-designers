<p><strong>Draw an object based on these instructions:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Draw a small circle. This is going to be the centre of the object. No lines ever go through it - the inside of the circle is always empty.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: There are several lines coming from the edge of the circle. All of them are the same length. Draw the first line that is pointing to the North and has a black triangle at the end (it looks like an arrow). </p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Draw the second line that is pointing to the East and has a black triangle at the end.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Draw the third line that is pointing to the South-East and has a black triangle at the end.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Draw the fourth line that is pointing to the South. This one has no triangle at the end.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Draw the fifth line that is pointing to the West. This one has no triangle at the end.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Draw a sixth line that is pointing to the North-West. This one has no triangle at the end.</p>
